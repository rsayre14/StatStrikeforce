# StatStrikeforce: A Multiplayer Gaming Statistics Tracker and Prediction Generator 
Developed by: Katherine McCarthy, Maxwell Mendenhall, Ryan Sayre

Debriefing with ourselves and reflecting on the final state of our project and how far we
have come to get to this point, a few initial changes we could have made come to mind. Firstly,
during conception, we should have utilized the free API’s that were available to us rather than
finding a loophole to obtain the RIOT API for Valorant. We wasted a sizeable amount of time
doing this, and we could have added more to our project in the meantime instead of finding this
loophole. Additionally, we would have added features such as a community page, adding the
ability to track other games, and finally, having the option to track multiple games, rather than
just Rainbow Six Siege. These features we wanted to implement into in our final build, and tried
to do so, but we simply did not have enough time, and we could have better coordinated our
efforts to try and achieve this. Cloud integration was the most difficult and time-consuming
aspect of our project, and our group concluded that some of our efforts would have been better
used for this aspect of the project to give us more time in the last week to focus on
implementing other functionalities.

One of the concepts we learned about and gained practical experience with was the
concept of http requests. Before this course, we all had a basic understanding of HTML, but
integrating this into a backend was a new concept for all of us. Through trial and error and by
researching how to execute these requests, we integrated our frontend and backend into a
complete application. Using gunicorn to run our backend was really crucial in learning how to
apply this to a cloud-based application and is a skill we certainly will use in future projects.
A concept we learned for the Web UI was that of using Bootstrap. Bootstrap is an
excellent tool in building and customizing web applications, and one which was a new
experience for us. Luckily, Bootstrap is a user-friendly software, and has dozens of templates
users can implement and use in their own projects. Knowing how these features work together
was essential in making the website aesthetic and easy to use, and paid off, as we are
exceptionally proud of the UI due to Bootstrap and its libraries. We believe the website's styling
and implementation of its features made it easier to use our application and test functionalities
in the cloud deployment phase towards the end of our project. Bootstrap is also simple to use,
and their website houses multiple tutorials to show how all the pieces of a Web-UI, like the
index, background, menuswap, and styles work together to create a beautiful and aesthetically
pleasing website for users.

Another key takeaway from this project was learning database design. While we had
introductory level MySQL knowledge going into this project, we did not have any practical
experience in designing a database to house all the data we needed and being able to query
data effectively. Learning the concept of primary and foreign keys along with table structure
really helped us come up with the final design for our database, which we are happy is
functional with storing the API data. We had hoped to finish implementing the account system,
but even just by making good progress with that feature we gained good experience in real
world problems like computer security in the cloud, and how to effectively store user data where
it is hidden from both administrators and possible invaders.

Although we were all mostly familiar with Python flask before delving into this project,
working with the backend and ML service helped to reinforce this skill for the future. We all have
become stronger Python programmers by working through this project and expanded our
knowledge into complex topics like complex class structure, large data transfers, and runtime
optimization, which are all extremely important in creating an efficient application. Learning
about the Machine Learning service and being able to transfer that knowledge into a working
Python script also reinforced these skills, and we are confident that this project has given us
good preparation for the technical challenges of working in a professional setting by providing
us with an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different frameworks that we tried
out when developing our application.

The skill we learned aligns with the class lectures and learning objectives of this course
most was the concept of cloud deployment. The class assignments and hands-on lectures gave
us a strong background for skills like docker image creation, containerization, and the concept
of utilizing cloud resources, and we were able to solidify these skills by applying them into our
own project. By doing this, we learned many important cloud computing skills, for example how
to write Dockerfiles, how to online tools like GitHub and DockerHub effectively, how to
containerize an application’s components, how to configure external ports, understanding
terminal commands and flags, and how to troubleshoot errors without having a modern IDE.
This class gave us full understanding of necessary skills about how the web applications we use
daily are developed and deployed, which will be very valuable in our professional endeavors. It
is also interesting to note that once you become aware of components of cloud computing, you
will see them everywhere. Our group had multiple discussions about how applications we use
everyday use concepts of cloud computing, and how these can relate back to our own project,
which helped to further enrich us with practical knowledge and understanding of computer
science topics.

The last, and perhaps most important skill we took away from working on this project
was the ability to collaborate. This was really our first experience with a collaborative
programming project, which comes with its own set of challenges for certain people. We agree
that what allowed us to thrive in this project was having a shared passion for the concept of
StatStrikeforce, and designing our project in a way that allowed each group member to highlight
a skill or feature they were personally passionate about while also working towards a shared
goal. Also, having a strong and clear concept for what we wanted the project to achieve from
the beginning was very important, because this kept us on track with the main objectives we
wanted to see implemented rather than having our scope for too broad and trying to implement
too many features from the beginning. Having weekly team meetings to work on the project and
being friendly outside of the project also helped us become more comfortable with each other,
which removed any personal confliction that could halt project progress, so even while working
through technical challenges we felt that progress was always being made. The ability to
collaborate on a computer science project is a very valuable skill to have professionally, and we
are glad to have been given the opportunity to experience this for our futures.

Overall, we are extremely pleased with our final project, and our success with applying
the concepts we learned in class by implementation into StatStrikeforce. We agreed that this
was a positive experience for all of us, with both the successes and challenges allowing us to
better understand how the Computer Science industry will look once we graduate. We really
enjoyed our time together, and created a bond that will last outside of StatStrikeforce. Our group
is lucky in the sense that we were all knowledgeable in our respective components of building
an application, so we were able to share our knowledge and help one another learn new skills
through collaborating. In the end we developed our project in a way that aligns with what we
originally envisioned and look forward to continuing to work on it in the future. While this project
posed many challenges for us, the reward of seeing its final stage speaks volumes to our
dedication and ability to demonstrate knowledge of complex cloud computing concepts.
